# RecursiveDescentParser
Designed a recursive descent parser for a CFG by writing a parsing function for each nonterminal symbol of that CFG.
  1. The main function of the program calls the function that corresponds to the start symbol.
  2. The output are statements of your input source with the appropriate error message (if any).
